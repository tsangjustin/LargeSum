Complete Project Euler #13. However, we will make the following 
modifications to the problem:

- Read all the large numbers from a file called "input.txt". We will use additional test cases with different numbers to test your algorithm.

- You may assume the file exists. Though error checking is nice, we will not require it.

- There will be anywhere from 0 to 200 numbers in the file.

- The numbers may have anywhere from 1 to 50 digits.

- The assignment must be done in Java. Name the class "LargeSum".

There should be exactly two lines of output from your program.  
Capitalization and spaces must be followed closely. 

See below:
Full sum: 1238561234576829475628947856287458923478362
First 10 digits: 1238561234

Submit LargeSum.java (not .class).  
Make sure the name of every member of the team is in the source code and in the comments section on Canvas.  Only one submission per team is required.
